Don't waste time filling in things not needed, if it is typo then clearly we don't need your save game, OS or anything like that, just give us the event and the typo. Use your common sense in working out what information is needed, though if unsure, er on the side of more rather than less.

Fill in the placeholders below. Delete any headings and placeholders that you do not fill in.
PLEASE CHECK IF THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN REPORTED BEFORE!
Make sure your title explains the issue well.

Before you report a crash (CTD) issue, please ensure the following:
1. You were not running any other mods (FR music mod is fine, others not made by the FR team are not - yes, this includes graphical mods and things you believe are harmless). No, disabling the mods for a game where you've been running with them active previously doesn't count. If you want to report it anyhow, that's fine, but please be honest about their use and know that we might reject the report if you're using mods we're unfamiliar with.
2. That you have a save to include which crashes consistently (meaning: on each reload, within a reasonable time)
3. Make sure you include the game log, found in C:\Users\NAME\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\logs
4. That you have the checksum on hand - this is the four-letter code at the bottom of your title menu, and is vital for us to know if your files match ours.

Thanks for your patience! We'll do our best to address the isssue, if we can.

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Be France

2. Go Monarchist

**Other info:**
The partition of Germany event, if Germany is in a faction with other nations, only gives France the land they occupied, no matter how much war score they have, giving a nation like Italy, for example, Austria, Hungary and Romania in my case, despite Italy not pushing past the Alps.

The puppeting of Germany screws with the Monarchist branch as, if you win against Germany and establish a Republic, you are blocked from taking the Empire focus, something which cannot be fixed no matter what you do as the German Republic has a different tag to the German Reich.

Units in the southernmost province of Pas de Calais do not have their Sprite nor icon places in the provinces rather, they are put in the next state down, something which can screw up offensives if not accounted for.

The "Confederation of the Rhine" path doesn't actually make the Rhineland free, they remain a puppet of France.

If you choose to defend Poland, and they've chosen to make their own faction, the guarantee doesn't work as it comes after Germany declares war meaning you are unable to intervene against Germany.

The 1940 Elections still happen even if France goes Monarchist, forcing you to become a republic once more unless you use cheats.

France doesn't gain the "Absolute Monarchy" or even "Parliamentary Monarchy" idea, meaning they remain a Parliamentary Republic despite not being a republic.

**Possible cause:**
Bad mod
